                <h3>Policy restricting personal use of Highbury Group Limited’s computers and systems</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="one">
                    <h3>1. PURPOSE </h3>
                    <p>To remain competitive, better serve our customers and provide our employees with the best tools to do their jobs, Highbury Group Limited (“the Company’) makes available to our workforce access to one or more forms of electronic media
                        and services, including but not limited to: computers, software, printers, copiers, files, databases, cellular phone, email, telephones, voicemail, online services, intranet, Internet, and the World Wide Web. Highbury Group Limited
                        encourages the use of these media and associated services because they can make communication more efficient and effective and because they are valuable sources of information about vendors, customers, technology, and new products
                        and services. However, all employees and everyone connected with the organization should remember that electronic media and services provided by the company are company property and their purpose is to facilitate and support company
                        business. All computer users have the responsibility to use these resources in a professional, ethical, and lawful manner. To ensure that all employees are responsible, the following guidelines have been established for using email
                        and the Internet. No policy can lay down rules to cover every possible situation. Instead, it is designed to express Highbury Group Limited philosophy and set forth general principles when using electronic media and services.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="two">
                    <h3>2. AUTHORIZATION </h3>
                    <p>
                        Access to the Highbury Group Limited technology resources is within the sole discretion of the Company. Generally, employees are given access to the Company's various technologies based on their job functions. Only employees whose job performance will
                        benefit from the use of the Company's technology resources will be given access to the necessary technology. Additionally, employees must successfully complete company- approved training before being given access to the Highbury
                        Group Limited technology resources.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="three">
                    <h3> 3. PROHIBITED COMMUNICATIONS</h3>
                    <p> Electronic media cannot be used for knowingly copying, transmitting, retrieving, or storing any communication that is:  Discriminatory or harassing.  Derogatory to any individual or group.  Obscene, sexually explicit, pornographic,
                        defamatory, or threatening.  In violation of any license governing the use of software.  Engaged in for any purpose that is illegal or contrary to Highbury Group Limited policy or in a manner contrary to the best interests of
                        the Company, in any way that discloses confidential or proprietary information of the Company or third parties, or for personal or pecuniary gain; or  Protected by copyrights laws unless the employee has the author's permission
                        or is accessing a single copy only for the employee's reference.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="four">
                    <h3>4. PROFESSIONAL CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
                    <p>It is important to maintain a proper spirit and tone to your communications over the system. The following guidelines are suggested: • Make your communications positive, constructive, complete, factual. • Never use all caps — that
                        is perceived as “SHOUTING!” • Avoid belaboring disagreements in email — there is a time for face-to-face meetings.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="five">
                    <h3>5. PERSONAL USE</h3>
                    <p>The computers, electronic media and services provided by Highbury Group Limited are primarily for business use to assist employees in the performance of their jobs. As long as personal use does not interfere with the employee's duties,
                        is not done for pecuniary gain, does not conflict with the Company's business, and does not violate any Company policy, occasional, or incidental use of electronic media (sending or receiving) for personal, non-business purposes
                        is understandable and acceptable, and all such use should be done in a manner that does not negatively affect the systems' use for their business purposes. However, employees are expected to demonstrate a sense of responsibility
                        and not abuse this privilege. The Company assumes no liability for loss, damage, destruction, alteration, disclosure, or misuse of any personal data or communications transmitted over or stored on the Company's technology resources.
                        The Company accepts no responsibility or liability for the loss or non-delivery of any personal electronic mail or voicemail communications or any personal data stored on any Company property. The Company strongly discourages employees
                        from storing any personal data on any of the Company's technology resources.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="six">
                    <h3> 6. ACCESS TO EMPLOYEE COMMUNICATIONS</h3>
                    <p>a) Generally, electronic information created and/or communicated by an employee using email, word processing, utility programs, spreadsheets, voicemail, telephones, and Internet access, and similar electronic media is not reviewed
                        by the company. However, the following conditions should be noted: Highbury Group Limited does routinely gather logs for most electronic activities or monitor employee communications directly, be it: i) Telephone Use and Voicemail:
                        Records are kept of all calls made from and to a given telephone extension. ii) Electronic Mail: Electronic mail is backed-up and archived. Although electronic mail is password protected, an authorized administrator can reset the
                        password and read electronic mail. iii) Document Use: Each document stored on Company computers has a history, which shows which users have accessed the document for any purpose. iv) Internet Use: Internet sites visited, the number
                        of times visited, and the total time connected to each site is recorded and periodically monitored. b) Highbury Group Limited reserves the right, at its discretion and without notice, to review any employee's electronic files and
                        messages to the extent necessary to ensure electronic media and services are being used in compliance with the law, this policy and other company policies, or to investigate misconduct, to locate information, or for any other business
                        purpose. Employees should understand, therefore, that they have no right of privacy with respect to any messages or information created or maintained on the Company's technology resources, including personal information or messages.
                        Accordingly, if they have sensitive information to transmit, they should use other means. All messages sent and received, including personal messages, and all data and information stored on the Company's electronic-mail system,
                        voicemail system, or computer systems are Company property regardless of the content. As such, the Company reserves the right to access all of its technology resources including its computers, voicemail, and electronic-mail systems,
                        at any time, in its sole discretion. Passwords do not confer any right of privacy upon any employee of the Company. Employees are expected to maintain their passwords as confidential. Employees must not share passwords and must
                        not access coworkers’ systems without express authorization. Deleting or erasing information, documents, or messages maintained on the Company's technology resources is, in most cases, ineffective. All employees should understand
                        that any information kept on the Company's technology resources may be electronically recalled or recreated regardless of whether it may have been "deleted" or "erased" by an employee. Because the Company periodically backs-up
                        all files and messages, and because of the way in which computers re-use file storage space, files and messages may exist that are thought to have been deleted or erased. Therefore, employees who delete or erase information or
                        messages should not assume that such information or messages are confidential.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="seven">
                    <h3>7. THE INTERNET AND ON-LINE SERVICES</h3>
                    <p>The Company provides authorized employees access to on-line services such as the Internet. The Company expects that employees will use these services in a responsible way and for business-related purposes only. Under no circumstances
                        are employees permitted to use the Company's Technology Resources to access, download, or contribute to the following: • gross, indecent, or sexually oriented materials. • sports sites: • job-search sites. • entertainment sites.
                        • gambling sites. • games, humor. • illegal drug-oriented sites. • personal pages of individuals; and • politically oriented sites or sites devoted to influencing the course of legislation or public policy. Additionally, employees
                        must not sign "guest books" at Websites or post messages to Internet news groups or discussion groups at Websites. These actions will generate junk electronic mail and may expose the Company to liability or unwanted attention because
                        of comments that employees may make. The Company strongly encourages employees who wish to access the Internet for non-work-related activities to get their own personal Internet access accounts.</p>

                <div class="eight">
                    <h3>8. PARTICIPATION IN ONLINE FORUMS </h3>
                    <p>a) Employees should remember that any messages or information sent on company-provided facilities to one or more individuals via an electronic network — for example, Internet mailing lists, and online services — are statements identifiable
                        and attributable to Highbury Group Limited. b) Highbury Group Limited recognizes that participation in some forums might be important to the performance of an employee's job. For instance, an employee might find the answer to a
                        technical problem by consulting members of a news group devoted to the technical area.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="nine">
                    <h3> 9. SOFTWARE</h3>
                    <p>To prevent computer viruses from being transmitted through the company's computer system, unauthorized downloading of any unauthorized software is strictly prohibited. Only software registered Through Highbury Group Limited may be
                        downloaded. No employee may load any software on the Company's computers, by any means of transmission, unless authorized in advance by Highbury Group Limited’s system administrator.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="ten">
                    <h3>10. SECURITY/APPROPRIATE USE</h3>
                    <p>a) Employees must respect the confidentiality of other individuals’ electronic communications. Except in cases in which explicit authorization has been granted by company management, employees are prohibited from engaging in, or attempting
                        to engage in: • Monitoring or intercepting the files or electronic communications of other employees or third parties. • Hacking or obtaining access to systems or accounts they are not authorized to use. • Using other people's
                        logins or passwords; and • Breaching, testing, or monitoring computer or network security measures. • No email or other electronic communications can be sent that attempt to hide the identity of the sender or represent the sender
                        as someone else. b) Electronic media and services should not be used in a manner that is likely to cause network congestion or significantly hamper the ability of other people to access and use the system. c) Anyone obtaining electronic
                        assess to other companies' or individuals' materials must respect all copyrights and cannot copy, retrieve, modify or forward copyrighted materials except as permitted by the copyright owner. e) The Company has installed a variety
                        of programs and devices to ensure the safety and security of the Company's technology resources. Any employee found tampering or disabling any of the Company's security devices will be subject to discipline up to and including
                        termination.

                <div class="eleven">
                    <h3>11. ENCRYPTION</h3>
                    <p>Employees can use encryption software supplied to them by the systems administrator for purposes of safeguarding sensitive or confidential business information. Employees who use encryption on files stored on a company computer must
                        provide their supervisor with a sealed hard copy record (to be retained in a secure location) of all the passwords and/or encryption keys necessary to access the files.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="twelve">
                    <h3> 12. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</h3>
                    <p>The Company is overly sensitive to the issue of protection of trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary information of both the Company and third parties ("Confidential Information"). Therefore, employees are expected to
                        use good judgment and to adhere to the highest ethical standards when using or transmitting Confidential Information on the Company's technology resources. Confidential Information should not be accessed through the Company's technology
                        resources in the presence of unauthorized individuals. Similarly, Confidential Information should not be left visible or unattended. Moreover, any Confidential Information transmitted via technology resources should be marked with
                        the following confidentiality legend: "This message contains confidential information. Unless you are the addressee (or authorized to receive for the addressee), you may not copy, use, or distribute this information. If you have
                        received this message in error, please return it promptly by mail."
